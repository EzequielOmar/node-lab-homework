Create your own realisation of EventEmitter. It should support 4 methods:
1. emitter.emit(eventName[, ...args])  - Synchronously calls each of the listeners
    registered for the event named eventName, in the order they were registered, passing the 
    supplied arguments to each.
2. emitter.on(eventName, listener) - Adds the listener function to the end of the listeners
    array for the event named eventName. No checks are made to see if the listener has already
    been added. Multiple calls passing the same combination of eventName and listener will result
    in the listener being added, and called, multiple times.
3. emitter.prependListener(eventName, listener) - Adds the listener function to the beginning of
    the listeners array for the event named eventName. No checks are made to see if the listener has
    already been added. Multiple calls passing the same combination of eventName and listener will 
    result in the listener being added, and called, multiple times.
4. emitter.removeListener(eventName, listener) - Removes the specified listener from the listener
    array for the event named eventName.
